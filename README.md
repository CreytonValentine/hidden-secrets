# Password Generator Starter Code

To generate a secure random password for users, when the user answers prompts for password criteria, the webpage will display a password choice for the user.

A html document will be created in order to link a JavaScript file which will be used to create the password generator

All progress made throughout the assignment will be staged and committed to a remote repository on github.
